# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Night Recommender: Clustering-Based Genre Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Choosing a movie for yourself is easy, but selecting one for a group can be challenging. People's movie preferences vary widely, and satisfying everyone is often difficult. This project leverages **clustering algorithms** to analyze viewer preferences and recommend movies that are **liked by most and disliked by few**. By grouping users based on their favorite genres, we can optimize the movie selection process for **group movie nights**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Understand audience preferences**: Analyze movie genre preferences among different users.  
- **Clustering for recommendations**: Use **unsupervised machine learning (K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering)** to group similar movie watchers.  
- **Reduce decision fatigue**: Suggest a movie that minimizes conflicts within a group.  
- **Challenge biases**: Investigate and visualize unexpected movie associations.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
